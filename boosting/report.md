# Adaboost algorithm explanation?

# Accuracy analysis

Plot of how the classification accuracy on training data depends on the number of weak classifier. Be sure to include:
- Number of training data (non-faces + faces).
- Number of Haar-Features.

The number of weak classifier chosen prior testing the data.

The accuracy on the test data after applying the optimized strong classifier.

Plots of some misclassified faces and non-faces that seem hard to classify correctly.

Defend your results, are they reasonable? Can we expect perfect results?
